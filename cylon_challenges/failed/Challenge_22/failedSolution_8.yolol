//Submission to Cylon challenge Lost In Space (22)

//Your spaceship is drifting through space at a constant velocity (starting at `0,0,0`), occasionally the spaceship will change direction. The velocity is never greater than 15m/s. Every input will tell you the current velocity _plus some random noise_. Output the current 3D position of the spaceship as accurately as possible.

//Fail exception: "Failed test case"
